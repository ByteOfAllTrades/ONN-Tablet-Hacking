# ONN-Tablet-Hacking
A repo that documents my exploration into finding cool uses for the walmart brand of super cheap tablets. Such as rooting, remote access, and even turning one into a nethunter. Enjoy! :)

The best tablets for this are the 10, 10.1, and 8' models. The 7" model is incompatible atm(Will update if this changes)

I Will also include DIY instructions with uses for the 7" models.
