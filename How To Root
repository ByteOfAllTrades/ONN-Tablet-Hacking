This file assumes you are starting with an OOTB(Out Of The Box Tablet) if you are not skip step 0.
Step 0 Set up the tablet for the first time:
--My personal preference is to create an email for that specific tablet(So I don't get mail from and about the tablet normally)
--The next steps are easier if you do not set a password to begin with
Step 1 Download twrp to computer:
---I Did not create this twrp image, I found it here https://forum.xda-developers.com/walmart-onn-tablets/walmart-onn-tablets-general/recovery-twrp-onn-android-tablets-t3999621
--Correct version is:
---ONA19TB002 - Onn 8" model
---ONA19TB003 - Onn 10.1" model
---ONA19TB007 - Onn 10.1" w/keyboard model
---Files are in repo
--Keep this file on hand for later
Step 2 Unlock the bootloader:
--Enable Dev mode on tablet
---System->About Tablet->Tap the build # until it says you're a dev
---Go to dev settings(Newly avaliable)
---enable usb debugging
---enable OEM Unlocking
--Connect device to PC
--It may ask you to enable usb debugging, select always allow
--Open a Command Prompt
****WARNING: THIS WILL WIPE YOUR DEVICE, PLEASE TRANSFER ANY DATA YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE BRUTALLY MURDERED OFF OF THE DEVICE****
--Issue commands as follows:
---adb devices
---adb reboot bootloader
---fastboot flashing unlock
--Follow the promts and select yes
--tablet should reboot, wiped, with an unlocked bootloader
--Easy way to tell is that the tablet will have a message that says Orange State
--Repeat Step 0
Step 3 Download Magisk Manager on the tablet:
--Newest Version
--Link: https://magiskmanager.com/
Step 4 Download Magisk Zip:
--Open Magisk Manager
--It should inform you that magisk zip has not been installed
--download the zip to a place you can remember
Step 5 Flash twrp and install magisk.zip:
--Issue commands as follows:
---adb devices
---adb reboot bootloader
---fastboot flash recovery **twrp.img file name**
---fastboot oem reboot recovery
--Once in twrp select install, then install magisk.zip
--reboot
Step 5 Congrats:
--You should now have a selective root availiable when you launch magisk
--Happy Customizing!
